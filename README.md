# Advent of Code {{year}}

### Usage
Add days with `./add_day.sh 1` where 1 is day to add.

This will add a src file for the day and add a match statement
in `main.rs` so You can easily run the day with `cargo run 1`
and tests with `cargo test day1`for example.


Benchmarking with [criterion.rs](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) can be run with `cargo bench -- "Day1"`


Check `helpers.rs` for some helper utilities for reading files to vectors and such.

**Happy coding!**
